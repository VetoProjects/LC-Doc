Live Coding Documentation
=========================

This repository contains the documentation available for our [Live Coding 
Application](https://github.com/hellerve/Veto-LiveCoding), a paper
(available as TeX and PDF) in the `german` directory. there will be one
in english, so as soon as you see a directory called `english` on this
very site we have translated the paper.

The german version is also directly accessible 
[at Veits' website](https://veitheller.de/static/Dokumentation.pdf).
